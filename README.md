## Synopsis

This repo contains provenance graphs in support of the paper "Provenance Data Sets Highlighting Capture Disparaties" (Coe, Doty, Allen, Chapman) submitted to TaPP'14.

## Structure

There are three directories:

* Complete (corresponding to samples in Figure 1 of the paper)
* App-Based (corresponding to samples in Figure 2a)
* Coordination (corresponding to samples in Figure 2b)

Each directory contains a numbered sample, 100 in total.  Numbered samples correspond across directories; that is, "Complete/Sample-1.xml" and "App-Based/Sample-1.xml" correspond to different views of the same provenance graph (see discussion in the paper).
